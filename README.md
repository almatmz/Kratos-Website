This project reflects Kratos's deep character arc:

- **Revenge Era (God of War I–III)**  
  Kratos begins as a brutal, vengeful warrior who seeks retribution against the gods of Olympus after they betrayed him. His rage consumes everything, leading to widespread destruction and tragedy.

- **Regret and Redemption Era (God of War 2018 and Ragnarök)**  
  Years later, Kratos is a changed man. Now a father, he hides from his past and tries to live a life of wisdom, teaching his son *Atreus* not to repeat his mistakes. His arc is one of guilt, growth, and redemption — choosing restraint over wrath.
